# Setting up a Django REST Framework project with PostgreSQL, Docker and django-allauth

Create a new Django REST Framework django-allauth with  project by running `startproject.sh <project name>`

It installs and freezes requirements, and configures the project settings and urls.py so that everything works "out-of-the-box".

Project can be then run with `docker-compose up`, which starts the PostgreSQL db and the web application.
