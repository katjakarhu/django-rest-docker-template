# Template for Django REST Framework projects with PostgreSQL, Docker and django-allauth

Create a new Django REST Framework project by running `startproject.sh <project name>`

It creates a new virtualenv for you, installs and freezes requirements, and configures the project settings and urls.

Project can be then run with `docker-compose up`.
